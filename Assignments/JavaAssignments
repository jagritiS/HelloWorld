Basic Java
1.Find out following output using java
String: Welcome to HackerRank's Java tutorials!
Double: 3.1415
Int: 42
for the following input
42
3.1415
Welcome to  Java tutorials!

2. show the following output from the following input
input
java 100
cpp 65
python 50
output
================================
java           100
cpp            065
python         050
================================
3.There are certain codes which determines whether they are postive and negative if the sentence contains "not" then it is negative and if it
  doesnt contains "not" then it is positive. and also ask the user for no of sentenses for eg:
  Input :
  No of sentenses : 3
  sentence 1 : this is not my name
  sentence 2 : this is my name
  sentense 3 : i am not going anywhere.

  Output:
  Positive sentence :
     sentence 2 : this is my name
  Negative Sentence
    sentence 1 : this is not my name
     sentense 3 : i am not going anywhere.if(btns.hasClass("btnStyle5")){
                    alert("yes opt 3 green");

Chef was reading some quotes by great people. Now, he is interested in classifying all the fancy quotes he knows.
He thinks that all fancy quotes which contain the word "not" are Real Fancy; quotes that do not contain it are regularly fancy.
4. Print the following output in a frame from the input given
input = ["Hello", "I", "am", "a", "Learner"], input can be of any range .
output
**************
* Hello      *
* I          *
* am         *
* a          *
* Learner    *

1.Create calculation between two numbers +using multiple class and constructors
2.Create student registration and display total students - using inheritance +multiple class
3.Find out prime numbers between any given range +multiple class
4.Swap any three user provided values +multiple class
5.Write a java program to compute the sum of digits of a number +multiple class
6.Find out smallest numbers from any three user given numbers +multiple class
7.Find the last 10 digit of sum series given series
1^1+2^2+3^3+4^4+.....1000^1000 = ?
answer is 9110846700
8. what is the smallest odd composite no that doesnt satisfy following
 7 = 5+2*1^2
 9  = 7 + 2*1^2
9. create an array capable of holding n integers and Modify the code in the loop so that it saves
each sequential value to its corresponding location in the array. For example, the first value must be
stored in , the second value must be stored in , and so on. for eg input is 56, 23, 12 98 then output will be
12,23,56,98
10.Remove the repeated elements in an array
for eg : array --> 10,20,2,10,34,11,20,2 output will be 10,20,2,34,11

Topic java 8
Lambda Expression
11.Given a number n returns a boolean indicating if it is odd.
12.Given a character c returns a boolean indicating if it is equal to ‘y’.
13.Given two numbers x and y returns another number with their summation.
14.Given two integers a and b returns another integer with the sum of their squares.
15.Given a string s prints the string to the main output and returns void.
16.Give no parameters prints Hello World! to the main output and returns void.
17.Check whether the number is odd,even, prime, composite,palindrome

Strings API
1. Reverse a string .
    Eg :Input :  this is the subject that i like the most.
    Output : .tsom eht ekil i taht tcejbus eht si siht
2.For a given string convert it to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it.Find and return the shortest
palindrome you can find by performing this transformation
Example input : aacecaaa
Output  : aaacecaaa
Input : abcd
Output : dcbabcd

File handling :
Input lines in a file followed by line number
for eg if lines are :
                        hello this is test
                        hi i m here
                        i like java
 then output in the file will be

                        1. hello this is test
                        2. hi i m here
                        3. i like java
